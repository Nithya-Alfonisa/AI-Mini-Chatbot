# AI-Mini-Chatbot  
A mini chatbot project created using DialogFlow and Python IDLE  

Welcome to my *Python Chatbot with GUI*, developed using the Tkinter library.  
This is a *self-initiated mini-project* that combines interactive design, logic building, and creative features â€” all aimed at enhancing user engagement.

## Why I Built This

I was curious to see how I could *practically apply my Python skills* â€” and this chatbot project was my way of turning theory into action.

I developed this completely at home using free online resources, and learned how to:
- Build GUIs using Tkinter  
- Handle user input and condition-based logic  
- Create engaging tools that feel dynamic and fun  

This project helped me move from *beginner to confident intermediate*, and has inspired me to create more innovative Python-based tools in the future.
